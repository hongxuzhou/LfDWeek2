# LfDWeek2
Learning from Data Week 2 Assignment: Named Entity Recognition
## Action Plan 

### Setup and Initial Exploration 

Create a new GitHub repository for the assignment
Clone the repository to your local machine
Set up the necessary Python environment with required libraries
Run the provided script with default settings to establish a baseline
Record baseline performance metrics


### Data Analysis  

Analyze the training and development datasets
Calculate and record the majority class baseline (for NN-1)
Examine the distribution of classes in the dataset
Create visualizations of data characteristics (e.g., word frequency, label distribution)
Commit and push your analysis code and results


### Model Experimentation  

Implement at least 3 different model architectures
Experiment with at least 2 different activation functions
Try at least 2 different optimizers
Implement dropout and test at least 3 different dropout rates
Experiment with at least 2 different learning rates
Test at least 2 different batch sizes
Commit each significant change separately with clear commit messages


### Hyperparameter Tuning  

Implement a method for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search or random search)
Test at least 10 different hyperparameter combinations
Record and compare the results of different configurations
Commit your hyperparameter tuning code and results


### Final Model Selection and Training 

Based on experiments, select the best performing model configuration
Train the final model, implementing early stopping
Evaluate the model on the development set
Make predictions on the test set if provided
Commit your final model code and results


### Error Analysis  

Analyze at least 50 misclassified instances from the development set
Identify and categorize at least 3 common error patterns
Create visualizations to illustrate error distributions
Commit your error analysis code and results


### Report Writing 

Write detailed answers to all 6 questions in the assignment
Include at least 1 visualization or table for each question where applicable
Ensure each answer is between 150-300 words
Commit your report draft


### Code Cleanup and Documentation  

Refactor your code for clarity and efficiency
Add comprehensive comments to all main functions and complex code blocks
Create a clear README.md file with instructions to run your code
Commit your cleaned-up code and documentation


### Final Review and Submission  

Review your entire GitHub repository for completeness
Ensure all code, analysis results, and the report are committed
Double-check that you've addressed all parts of the assignment
Make your final commit and push to GitHub
Submit your assignment according to the instructor's guidelines
